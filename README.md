# April Fools

For one day of the year, a victim of your choosing will see a pink toolbar when logged into a site with this plugin active.

## Installation

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `april-fools` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or to prevent deactivation, upload to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`)

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. In the `april-fools.php` file, change the numeric value of the `$victim` variable to match the user ID of your victim
